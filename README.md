# Task Manager App

## Overview

This is a simple task manager application built with React. It allows users to sign up, log in, add tasks, search for tasks, and delete tasks. The application utilizes React Router for navigation and localStorage for storing user information and tasks.

## Functionality

- **Signup**: Users can sign up with a username and password. Upon successful signup, their credentials are stored locally.
- **Login**: Registered users can log in with their credentials. Upon successful login, they are redirected to the home page.
- **Home**: After login, users are taken to the home page where they can view their tasks, add new tasks, search for tasks, and delete tasks. Users can also log out from this page.
- **Task Management**: Users can add new tasks by providing a name and description. They can search for tasks by name and delete tasks they no longer need.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

3. **Access the application**:

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to access the application.

## Assumptions

During development, the following assumptions were made:

1. Users are only required to provide a username and password for signup. Additional information such as email or profile details are not necessary for this application.
2. User authentication is handled locally using localStorage for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, a more secure authentication mechanism with server-side validation and JWT tokens might be implemented.
3. Tasks are stored locally in the browser's localStorage. In a production environment, tasks would typically be stored in a database on the server.
4. The application is designed for demonstration purposes and may not be suitable for production use without further enhancements, particularly in terms of security and scalability.
